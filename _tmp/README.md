# Gemfile cache

This is a copy of the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` file generated ~September 2014.

The versions of libraries available in January 2015 prevent Middleman from serving content (exits without any error message).

If you can't start the server then copy this `Gemfile.lock` and rerun `bundle exec middleman server`.
